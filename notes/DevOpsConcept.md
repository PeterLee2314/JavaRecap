#### DevOps

### CI/CD 
Agile (2-3 week part of product to client) eg some features => better feedback
Unit Testing + Integration Testing (When integrate modules) => Automation Test (Bugs could Happen) => Solution : CI
Continuous Integration (Commit on the Github everytime it will build and execute the automation test, every commit will execute a test)
Continuous Delivery (After commit it may done the features, show them in a mock server and run current project, show things are working + client understand it + know performance)
Eventually, we manually deploy it on Production server
Continuous Deployment (When commit to github, it build and automate test, once pass , it Automatically pushed to production server)
Integration (Pushing Code) , Delivery (making it available for deployment), Deployment (pushed to production server)
Some company go CI, some company go CD 
eg MicroService, company go for Continuous Deployment
Diificult, team ready, pipeline
